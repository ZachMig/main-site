    <p>
      Thank you for clicking through to my project demo.<br><br>
      This is a demonstration of a <b>REST</b> server connected to a database, and this client webpage to use the service.<br>
      The front end consists entirely of this landing page and a small Javascript file.<br>
      The REST service is a <b>Spring Boot</b> project written in <b>Java</b>.<br>
      The data is contained in a <b>MySQL</b> database which is hooked up to the REST service via <b>Hibernate ORM</b>.<br>
      The REST service and database are both hosted on an <b>AWS EC2</b> instance.<br>
      Routing for zachmig.com and api.zachmig.com are handled by the <b>AWS Route 53</b> service.<br>
      This page is contained in an <b>AWS S3</b> bucket. Requests to www.zachmig.com are passed to this bucket as well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      This page represents the client side.<br>
      There isn't anything on the front end in the way of exception handling or compatibility.<br>
      The Javascript waits for the user to select a country from the dropdown and uses the input to build a URL for a fetch() call to www.api.zachmig.com.<br>
      The JSON response is then loaded into a table and displayed on the page.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The fetch() call is made to "http://www.api.zachmig.com:8080/country?name=United_States_of_America".<br>
      This URL points to an endpoint of a REST API.<br>
      Upon receiving the GET request, the REST service builds a SELECT query using the country name and runs it against the database.<br>
      The results of the query are serialized into objects and then finally into a JSON response which is served to the requester.
