    <div class="section-content">
      I am an NY-based software developer looking for work in an entry or junior-level position. I previously worked an 8 month full-time internship at Thomson Reuters, but have been working in an unrelated field since then. Since then, I have been keeping up on my technical skills, and am excited to get back into professional development.

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
      I am most comfortable working in core Java. Eclipse is my IDE of choice but I would be happy to learn any others. I can definitely handle database work and SQL as well, and have experience using JDBC and Hibernate.
      <br><br>
      I am comfortable using Git from the command line, so changing IDE would not be an issue for me.
      <br><br>
      With some help from Google, I can do basic frontend work as well. I am certainly not insistent on backend work exclusively, and would be excited to end up in a full-stack position.
