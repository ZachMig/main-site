      This is a demonstration of a <b>REST</b> server connected to a database, and this client webpage to use the service.<br>
      The REST service is a <b>Spring Boot</b> project written in <b>Java</b>.<br>
      The data is contained in a <b>MySQL</b> database which is hooked up to the REST service via <b>Hibernate ORM</b>.<br>
      The REST service and database are both hosted on an <b>AWS EC2</b> instance.<br>
      Routing for zachmig.com and api.zachmig.com are handled by the <b>AWS Route 53</b> service.<br>
      This page is contained in an <b>AWS S3</b> bucket. Requests to www.zachmig.com are passed to this bucket as well.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        This page represents the client side.<br>
        There isn't anything on the front end in the way of exception handling or compatibility.<br>
        The Javascript waits for the user to select a country from the dropdown and uses the input to build a URL for a fetch() call to www.api.zachmig.com.<br>
        The JSON response is then loaded into a table and displayed on the page.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The fetch() call is made to "http://www.api.zachmig.com:8080/country?name=United_States_of_America".<br>
        This URL points to an endpoint of a REST API.<br>
        Upon receiving the GET request, the REST service builds a SELECT query using the country name and runs it against the database.<br>
        The results of the query are serialized into objects and then finally into a JSON response which is served to the requester.

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
      I am most comfortable working in core Java. Eclipse is my IDE of choice but I would be happy to learn any others. I can definitely handle database work and SQL as well, and have experience using JDBC and Hibernate.
      <br><br>
      I am comfortable using Git from the command line, so changing IDE would not be an issue for me.
      <br><br>
      Backend work is my strength, but I would be more than happy to end up in a frontend or fullstack position.

    <h2>Other Work</h2> 
    <div class="section-content">
      Having spent several years working in luxury goods sales, I have built a range of relevant, transferable skills that supplement my technical ability.<br><br>
      My workdays were spent in a high-pressure environment with multiple overlapping deadlines, and so the first things I had to learn were teamwork and efficient task management. 
      Meeting these deadlines typically involved disruptions that were out of our control, so I learned to quickly adapt to changing circumstances, and to move forward despite
        unplanned setbacks.
      Working with customers made me into an effective communicator, and when speaking, I can filter out information that is not relevant to my audience, and focus on what's
        important.<br><br>
      In short, I can keep a level head in any situation, understand which tasks and deadlines are most crucial, and deliver quality results as a part of any team.
